\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro}

%Many structural biomaterials achieve outstanding macroscale mechanical properties such as strength, stiffness, and toughness through the geometric arrangement of their constituent components at the microscale~\cite{meyers2013structural}. Such examples of microstructural complexity is the multilayered structures with helical symmetry found in the osteon of bone~\cite{wegst2015bioinspired}, artery walls~\cite{Gasser2006}, the wall structures of wood~\cite{Fratzl2007} and bamboo~\cite{wai1985morphological}, and sea sponge skeletons~\cite{Aizenberg2005} etc (Fig.~\ref{fig:Laminatedbiomaterials}). The multilayered structures with helical symmetry are also found in materials such as multi-walled nanotube~\cite{Delgado2008} and filament-wound composite pipes. The macroscale performances of multilayered structures are determined by the microscale properties of individual layers, the interface between the layers, and the layer arrangement. Therefore the understanding of connections between the macroscale properties and micro structures is useful to guide the design of biologically inspired materials with tailorable properties.

Structural biomaterials such as mother of pearl (nacre)~\citet{jackson1988mechanical},
spicules~\citet{monn2015new}, and bones~\citet{wegst2015bioinspired}

, structural biomaterials can serve as fascinating model material
systems for the discovery of new mechanics of materials principles. 

The remarkable enhancement in the structural biomaterials' macro-scale
properties in comparison to their micro-scale properties is believed
to be due to the highly organized and quite elaborate architecture
in which the mineral \textcolor{red}{phases is} interlaid with the
\textcolor{red}{organics} phase.$\clubsuit$ A number of studies have
been performed to delineate the mechanical principles that quantitatively
capture the relationship between large-scale mechanical properties
and small-scale architecture.$\clubsuit$ In most of those studies
the focus has been on the brick-mortar architecture which can be described
as a ordered stacking of thin flat platelets.$\clubsuit$ For example,
Gao and co-workers~\citet{gao2006application,ji2010mechanical} developed
a multi-level staggered mechanical (tension-shear chain) model for
a self-similar bone to understand the role of hierarchical structures
of bone.$\clubsuit$ Bertoldi et al.~\citet{bertoldi2008nacre} derived
the effective stiffness tensor of nacre based on the tension-shear
chain model through the homogenization technique and showed that nacre
was orthotropic and had different Young's modulus when in tension
and compression.$\clubsuit$ Rim et al.~\citet{rim2011dimensional}
performed a parametric analysis to investigate the effect of the microstructure
geometry on the nacre-inspired composite's strength and toughness.$\clubsuit$
Begley et al.~\citet{begley2012micromechanical} developed a micromechanical
model to evaluate the effective properties of the brick-mortar composite,
such as elastic modulus, strength and work-to-failure. Shao et al.~\citet{shao2012discontinuous}
presented a microstructure-based fracture mechanics model to study
the toughening effect due to the crack-bridging mechanism of platelets
in nacre.$\clubsuit$ 

However, there exist a large number of structural biomaterials with
cylindrical structures and displaying a helical symmetry%
\begin{comment}

\begin{comment}
\textcolor{teal}{HK to WF: The previous colored sentence can be deleted.
Or may be the introduction could be in the form of how many biological
materials are found in the structures that function as beams (support
bending momemnts) and columns (support axial loads). }
\end{comment}
\textcolor{teal}{}%
\begin{comment}
\textcolor{teal}{HK to WF: I think cell walls (in wood) and osteons
support compressive loads, do you agree? And spicules support bending
loads. The arterial walls are more like a pressure vessel. That is
they support internal pressure. It is also possible that there might
be some axial loads on areteries. However, it is unclear to me whether
those loads or tensile or compressive. If I have to guess I would
guess that those loads are compressive. }

\textcolor{teal}{The point is that these structures all might look
similar but support different types of loads. }

\textcolor{teal}{Even so, I think the bending stiffness might be important

{} Furthermore, some other helical structural biomaterials are often

how about \textquotedbl multilayered cylindrical beam,\textquotedbl{}

. This multilayered helical structure is observed in the osteon of
bone~\citet{wegst2015bioinspired}, the artery wall~\citet{Gasser2006},
and the wood's cell wall~\citet{Fratzl2007} etc. (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Laminatedbiomaterials}~$\subf{D-F}$).
Some engineering materials such as multiwalled carbon nanotube (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:Laminatedbiomaterials}~$\subf{G}$) and filament-wound
composite pipes have multilayered helical structure as well. Although
the property-structure connection of biomaterials with brick-mortar
architecture has been extensively studied, the relationship between
the effective mechanical properties and the small-scale architectures
for structural biomaterials consisting of cylindrical layers with
helical symmetries is much elusive.

Most of the multilayered structural biological and engineering composite
materials are essentially anisotropic and heterogeneous. Moreover,
the helical symmetric layers of the structures are cylindrical orthotropic.
Understanding and analyzing the overall deformation of such materials
with multilayered anisotropic cylindrical microstructures requires
the knowledge of their effective (i.e., homogenized) elastic properties,
which can be obtained through the anisotropic elasticity theory and
homogenization theory. The theory of anisotropic elasticity in the
cylindrical coordinates system is developed and summarized in monographs
by~\citet{Lekhnitskii1981,Ting1996anisotropic}. Analytical solutions
for displacement and stress analysis of anisotropic composite cylinders
subjected to typical loading conditions such as tension, shear, torsion,
pressuring, thermal deformation and bending are extensively studied,
for example, see~\citet{kollar1992stress,kollar1992composite,Jolicoeur1994,ting1996pressuring,chen2000revisit,tarn2001laminated,huang2001analysis,xia2002bending,crossley2003analytical,tsukrov2010elastic}
etc. Inspired by those analytical solutions, a recent study by Gnoli
et al.~\citet{gnoli2020homogenization} compared the stiffnesses
of the fiber-reinforced cylinder composite beams with various lamination
schemes. One interesting observation is that all stiffness constants
seem to become stable when three or four layers are considered in
the composite beams. %One approach to investigate the macroscale effective properties is the standard asymptotic homogenization method, a two-scale technique that uses asymptotic expansions of displacement and stress fields and appropriate variational principles to analyze characteristics of heterogeneous materials, cf. the monographs by~\cite{bensoussan2011asymptotic} and~\cite{sánchez1980nonhomogeneous} and recent reviews by~\cite{kalamkarov2009asymptotic},~\cite{pindera2009micromechanics}, and~\cite{charalambakis2010homogenization}.

Regarding the homogenization of multilayered cylindrical structures,
Chatzigeorgiou et al.~\citet{chatzigeorgiou2008homogenization} studied
the homogenized elastic coefficients of an anisotropic hollow layered
tube with discontinuous elastic constants under axisymmetric loading
condition. They~\citet{chatzigeorgiou2012effective} also proposed
a modified asymptotic expansion homogenization method to compute effective
thermomechanical properties of composites with periodicity in cylindrical
coordinates. By taking into account the discontinuous stress and strain
distributions in each layer, Sun et al.~\citet{sun2014homogenization,sun2014stress}
proposed a force-displacement equivalence method to determine the
homogenized elastic constants of general multilayered composite cylindrical
structures with curvilinear orthotropy. However, the lack of asymptotic
analysis makes their method too complicated to apply in practice since
the formulations involves the number of layers in the cylindrical
composite.

In this paper we derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic
bending stiffness of multilayered composite cylinderss with cylindrical
orthotropy by performing asymptotic analysis on the bending stiffness
formula obtained by Jolicoeur and Cardou~\citet{Jolicoeur1994}.
Both the interfacial conditions between adjacent layers and the lamination
schemes of the layers are considered. It is found that the effective
bending stiffness of multilayered cylindrical orthotropic structure
with frictionless interfaces converges as the number of layers become
infinity. Furthermore, the asymptotic bending stiffness of perfectly
bonded multilayered cylindrical structures consisting of heterogeneous
materials is higher than that of structures made of either constituent
material.

The paper is organized as follows:~$\S$\ref{sec:bending_model}
describes the model problem of pure bending of multilayered cylindrical
structures and summaries the results obtained by Jolicoeur and Cardou.~$\S$\ref{sec:limit_analysis}
presents the asymptotic analysis procedures of bending stiffness of
the structure. The expressions of asymptotic bending stiffness for
different interfacial conditions and lamination schemes are derived.~$\S$\ref{sec:discussion}
illustrates the numerical examples and discussions of the results.
The final section includes the major conclusions.

\section{Pure bending of multilayered composite cylinders with cylindrical
orthotropy}

\label{sec:bending_model}

We take~$\mathbb{E}$ to be a three dimensional, oriented, Hilbert
space and introduce vectors~$(\physe_{1},\physe_{2},\physe_{3})$
to form a basis for~$\mathbb{E}$. The vectors~$\physe_{1}$,~$\physe_{2}$,
and~$\physe_{3}$ are orthonormal, that is,~$\physe_{i}\cdot\physe_{j}=\delta_{ij}$,
for~$i$,~$j\in(1,2,3)$, where the Kronecker delta symbol~$\delta_{ij}$
is defined as unity if~$i=j$ and zero otherwise. We also introduce
a set of orthonormal vectors~$(\physe_{r},\physe_{\theta},\physe_{z})$
as a basis for a global cylindrical coordinate system. The dependence
of~$(\physe_{r},\physe_{\theta},\physe_{z})$ on~$(\physe_{1},\physe_{2},\physe_{3})$
is given by 

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} \physe_{r} & = \cos(\theta) \physe_1 + \sin(\theta) \physe_2 , \\ \physe_{\theta} & = -\sin(\theta) \physe_1 + \cos(\theta) \physe_2 , \\ \physe_{z} & =  \physe_3. \end{align} \end{subequations}

We consider a hollow composite cylinder, whose axis is aligned with~$\physe_{z}$
and cross sections are in~$(\physe_{r},\physe_{\theta})$ plane (Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}~$\subf{A}$).
The inner and outer radius of the cylinder is~$r_{0}$ and~$r_{N}$,
respectively. The cylinder consists of~$N$ co-axial cylindrical
layers and each layer is cylindrical orthotropic with different principal
material property orientations (see Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}~$\subf{B}$).

For an individual layer of material, we construct a local cylindrical
coordinate system according to the principal material property orientation
of the layer. We refer to the local cylindrical coordinate system
as the material coordinate system. It is a rotation of the global
cylindrical coordinate system through an angle~$\varphi$, the so-called
helical angle, in clockwise direction with respect to the axis~$\physe_{r}$.
We denote the basis of the material coordinate system as~$(\physe'_{r},\physe'_{\theta},\physe'_{z})$,
where 

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} \physe'_{r} & =  \physe_r ,\\ \physe'_{\theta} & = \cos(\varphi) \physe_{\theta} - \sin(\varphi) \physe_z , \\ \physe'_{z} & = \sin(\varphi) \physe_{\theta} + \cos(\varphi) \physe_z . \end{align} \end{subequations}

% ,~$\physe_3$ is the longitudinal direction making an angle~$\varphi$, the so-called helical angle, with the cylinder axis, and the direction perpendicular to~$\physe_3$ and~$\physe_1$ is defined as tangential direction~$\physe_2$.

The solution of a single cylinder with cylindrical orthotropy subjected
to pure bending was obtained by Lekhnitskii~\citet{Lekhnitskii1981}.
Jolicoeur and Cardou extended this method to a more general bending
problem of a co-axial array of~$N$ cylindrical layers with cylindrical
orthotropy. Each cylindrical layers have different helical angles
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}~$\subf{B}$). The interfaces between
adjacent layers could be either perfectly bonded or frictionless.
The elastic problem is solved by using stress function method with
assumptions that the elastic cylinder is under small strains, the
loads along~$z$-axis are constant, no shear load resultant, and
stresses and strains only depend on~$r$ and~$\theta$, which implies
constant curvature of the bent cylinder. In the following, we describe
the generalized Hooke's law of cylindrical orthotropy in~$\S$\ref{sec:MatrixTrans}.
The results that are obtained by Jolicoeur and Cardou and relevant

\subsection{Transformation of constitutive law}

\label{sec:MatrixTrans} The generalized Hooke's law is 
\begin{equation}
\u{\sigma}=\mathbb{C}\,\u{\epsilon},\label{eq:GeneralizedHooke}
\end{equation}
where~$\u{\sigma}$,~$\u{\epsilon}$, and~$\mathbb{C}$ are the
Cauchy stress tensor, infinitesimal strain tensor and elastic stiffness
tensor, respectively. Eqn.~\eqref{eq:GeneralizedHooke} can be inverted
as 
\begin{equation}
\u{\epsilon}=\mathbb{S}\,\u{\sigma},\label{eq:GeneralizedHookeInverse}
\end{equation}
where~$\mathbb{S}=\mathbb{C}^{-1}$ is the elastic compliance tensor.

In the material coordinate system, we rewrite Eqn.~\eqref{eq:GeneralizedHookeInverse}
with index notation as 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon'_{ij}=S'_{ijkl}\sigma'_{kl},\label{eq:GeneralizedHookeComponents}
\end{equation}
where and~$\epsilon'_{ij}$,~$S'_{ijkl}$, and~$\sigma'_{kl}$
are the components of~$\u{\sigma}$,~$\mathbb{S}$, and~$\u{\epsilon}$,
respectively, with respect to the basis~$(\physe'_{r},\physe'_{\theta},\physe'_{z})$.
For helical fibers with cylindrical orthotropy, the elastic compliance
components,~$S'_{ijkl}$, are constant from point to point in its
material coordinate system. In order to express Eqn.~\eqref{eq:GeneralizedHookeComponents}
in terms of matrices, we use Voigt notation. We introduce elastic
compliance matrix~$\usf{S}=\pr{S_{ij}}_{i,j\in\mathcal{I}}$, where~$\mathcal{I}=\pr{1,\ldots,6}$.
According to the convention of Voigt notation, the non-zero elements
of~$\usf{S}$ are defined as 
\begin{align*}
 & S_{11}=S'_{rrrr},\quad S_{12}=S'_{rr\theta\theta},\quad S_{13}=S'_{rrzz},\\
 & S_{22}=S'_{\theta\theta\theta\theta},\quad S_{23}=S'_{\theta\theta zz},\quad S_{33}=S'_{zzzz},\\
 & S_{44}=2S'_{\theta z\theta z},\quad S_{55}=2S'_{rzrz},\quad S_{66}=2S'_{r\theta r\theta}.
\end{align*}
We define engineering strain

Therefore, we express Eqn.~\eqref{eq:GeneralizedHookeComponents}
as 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon'_{rr}\\
\epsilon'_{\theta\theta}\\
\epsilon'_{zz}\\
2\epsilon'_{\theta z}\\
2\epsilon'_{rz}\\
2\epsilon'_{r\theta}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
S_{12} & S_{22} & S_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
S_{13} & S_{23} & S_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & S_{44} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & S_{55} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & S_{66}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sigma'_{rr}\\
\sigma'_{\theta\theta}\\
\sigma'_{zz}\\
\sigma'_{\theta z}\\
\sigma'_{rz}\\
\sigma'_{r\theta}
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation}

It is desirable to carry out the analysis in the global cylindrical
coordinate system of the structure. Therefore we need to transform
the constitutive equation from the material coordinate system to the
global cylindrical coordinate system. As discussed in~$\S$~\ref{sec:bending_model},
The material coordinates are related to the global cylindrical coordinates
by a rotation of angle~$\varphi$ about axis~$\physe_{r}$. Thus,
through coordinate transformation, the compliance form of the generalized
Hooke's law in the global cylindrical coordinate system becomes 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon_{rr}\\
\epsilon_{\theta\theta}\\
\epsilon_{zz}\\
2\epsilon_{\theta z}\\
2\epsilon_{rz}\\
2\epsilon_{r\theta}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} & C_{14} & 0 & 0\\
C_{12} & C_{22} & C_{23} & C_{24} & 0 & 0\\
C_{13} & C_{23} & C_{33} & C_{34} & 0 & 0\\
C_{14} & C_{24} & C_{34} & C_{44} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{55} & C_{56}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{56} & C_{66}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{rr}\\
\sigma_{\theta\theta}\\
\sigma_{zz}\\
\sigma_{\theta z}\\
\sigma_{rz}\\
\sigma_{r\theta}
\end{array}\right],\label{eq:HookeGlobal}
\end{equation}
where the transformed elastic compliance matrix~$\pr{C_{ij}}_{i,j\in\mathcal{I}}$,
denoted by~$\usf{C}$, should not be confused with the elastic stiffness
tensor~$\mathbb{C}$. The relation between~$\usf{C}$ and~$\usf{S}$
is given by \begin{subequations} \begin{equation} \usf{C}= \usf{R}^{-\text{T}}\usf{S}\usf{R}^{-1}, \end{equation} where \begin{equation} 	\usf{R} 	:= 	\left[ 	\begin{array}{cccccc} 	 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 	 0 & c^2 & s^2 & 2sc & 0 & 0 \\ 	 0 & s^2 & c^2 & -2sc & 0 & 0 \\ 	 0 & -sc & sc & c^2 - s^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 	 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c & -s \\ 	 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & s & c \\ 	\end{array} 	\right], \end{equation} \end{subequations}with~$s=\sin\varphi$
and~$c=\cos\varphi$~\citet{Bower2009}.

It should be noted that the thirteen non-zero constants~$C_{ij}$
are computed from the nine independent non-zero compliance constants~$S_{ij}$
and the helix angle~$\varphi$. Thus, they are not independent. The
reduced elastic constants~$\beta_{ij}$ are also useful in the subsequent
sections and they are defined in terms of~$C_{ij}$ as 
\begin{equation}
\beta_{ij}=C_{ij}-\frac{C_{i3}C_{3j}}{C_{33}},
\end{equation}
for~$i,j\in\mathcal{I}$. It can be easily shown that~$\pr{\beta_{ij}}_{i,j\in\mathcal{I}}$
is symmetric and the number of independent non-zero elements is nine.

\subsection{Bending stiffness formula by Jolicoeur and Cardou\label{sec:bending stiffness}}

The bending stiffness of the~$N$-layer cylindrical composite is
obtained by Jolicoeur and Cardou as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}EI= & \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,n}K_{i,n}(r_{n-1}^{m_{i,n}+2}-r_{n}^{m_{i,n}+2})+\gamma_{n}(r_{n-1}^{4}-r_{n}^{4})\right],\end{aligned}
\label{eq:EI}
\end{equation}
with

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	\alpha_{i,n} & := \frac{\pi}{C_{33,n}} \frac{  C_{13,n} + C_{23,n}(m_{i,n} + 1) - C_{34,n} g_{i,n} m_{i,n} }{m_{i,n}+2}, \\ 	\gamma_n & := \frac{\pi}{C_{33,n}} \frac{ \mu_{1,n} (C_{13,n} + 3C_{23,n}) - 2\mu_{2,n} C_{34,n} - 1  }{4}, 	\end{align} \end{subequations}where~$N$
denotes the total number of layers,~$\mathcal{J}=\pr{1,2,3,4}$,~$r_{n-1}$
and~$r_{n}$ the internal and external radii of the~$n^{\text{th}}$
layer,~$m_{i,n}$,~$g_{i,n}$,~$\mu_{1,n}$, and~$\mu_{2,n}$
are material constants related with elastic constants of the~$n^{\text{th}}$
layer (see~\ref{Appen:MatConst}).

The coefficients~$K_{i,n}$ are determined by the boundary conditions
and continuity conditions of displacement and stress at the interface.

\paragraph{Boundary condition.}

The traction free boundaries at innermost radius~$r_{0}$ and outermost
radius~$r_{N}$ require 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,1} r_0^{m_{i,1}-2} & = -\mu_{1,1}, \quad 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,1} g_{i,1} r_0^{m_{i,1}-2} = -\mu_{2,1},\\ 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,N} r_N^{m_{i,N}-2} & = -\mu_{1,N}, \quad 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,N} g_{i,N} r_N^{m_{i,N}-2} = -\mu_{2,N}. 	\end{align} 	\label{eq:boundary} \end{subequations}

\paragraph{Interfacial condition: no friction.}

In the case of no friction interface,~$u_{r}$ and~$\sigma_{rr}$
are continuous,~$\tau_{r\theta}$ and~$\tau_{rz}$ are zero at the
interface. Therefore~$K_{i,n}$ satisfy following equations \begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,n} r_{n}^{m_{i,n}-2} & = -\mu_{1,n}, \quad 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,n} g_{i,n} r_{n}^{m_{i,n}-2} = -\mu_{2,n}, \\ 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,n} r_{n-1}^{m_{i,n}-2} & = -\mu_{1,n}, \quad 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K_{i,n} g_{i,n} r_{n-1}^{m_{i,n}-2} = -\mu_{2,n}, 	\end{align} 	\label{eq:nofriction_interface} \end{subequations}
for~$n=1,2,\dots,N$.

\paragraph{Interfacial condition: no slip.}

In the case of perfect bonding (no slip) interface between layers,
the continuity conditions of stresses~$\sigma_{rr}$,~$\tau_{r\theta}$,~$\tau_{rz}$
and displacements~$u_{r}$,~$u_{\theta}$,~$u_{z}$ at the interface
yields 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} \left( K_{i,n} r^{m_{i,n}-2} - K_{i,n+1} r^{m_{i,n+1}-2} \right) = \mu_{1,n+1} - \mu_{1,n}, \\ 	& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} \left( K_{i,n} g_{i,n} r^{m_{i,n}-2} - K_{i,n+1} g_{i,n+1} r^{m_{i,n+1}-2} \right) = \mu_{2,n+1} - \mu_{2,n}, \\ 	& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} \left( K_{i,n} Q_{i,n} r^{m_{i,n}-2} - K_{i,n+1} Q_{i,n+1} r^{m_{i,n+1}-2} \right) = Q_{5,n+1} - Q_{5,n}, \\ 	& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} \left( K_{i,n} W_{i,n} r^{m_{i,n}-2} - K_{i,n+1} W_{i,n+1} r^{m_{i,n+1}-2} \right) = W_{5,n+1} - W_{5,n}, 	\end{align} 	\label{eq:noslip_interface} \end{subequations}for~$n=1,2,\dots,N-1$,
where~$Q_{i}$ and~$W_{i}$ ($i=$1 to 5) are material constants
(see~\ref{Appen:MatConst}).

\section{Effective bending stiffness\label{sec:limit_analysis} }

In this section, we derive the asymptotic bending stiffness of multilayer
cylindrical structure. Specifically, for a given lamination scheme,
we analyze the asymptotic behavior of Eqn.~\eqref{eq:EI} by limiting
the total number of layers,~$N$, to infinity. The asymptotic expansion
is performed under the following assumptions: (i) We assume that the
cross-section area of the structure is constant and the thickness
of each layer is equal and vanishing as~$N$ goes to infinity. (ii)
We also assume that the constitutive properties of all layers are
the same in their own material coordinate system. But the principal
material property orientations, i.e. helical angles, of the layers
may be different.

We use the stacking-sequence notation to describe the spatial arrangement
of layers' helical angles. As per stacking-sequence notation, we use~$[\varphi_{0}]_{N}$
to denote a lamination scheme consisting of~$N$ layers and all layers
have same helical angle,~$\varphi_{0}$. For this lamination scheme,
the material property of a material point does not change with its
position in the cylinder. Thus the material is essentially homogeneous.
We also consider cases where the helical angles are not uniform and
the composed material becomes heterogeneous. We use~$[\varphi_{I}/\varphi_{II}]_{N/2}$
to denote a lamination scheme consisting of~$N$ layers where layers
with helical angles~$\varphi_{I}$ and~$\varphi_{II}$ are alternatively
arranged.

Based on the lamination schemes and interfacial conditions, we consider
three different scenarios here. (i) Homogeneous material-No friction:
the lamination scheme is~$[\varphi_{0}]_{N}$ and no friction exists
between layers. (ii) Heterogeneous material-No friction: the lamination
scheme is~$[\varphi_{I}/\varphi_{II}]_{N/2}$ and the interfaces
between layers is frictionless. (iii) Heterogeneous material-No slip:
the lamination scheme is~$[\varphi_{I}/\varphi_{II}]_{N/2}$ as well,
but there is no slip between the interfaces.

\subsection{Homogeneous material and no friction interface\label{sec:1mat_no_friction}}

First we consider that the elastic property for each layer is the
same. The interfaces between layers are frictionless. This is equivalent
to the scenario where a homogeneous cylinder is cut into layers with
uniform thickness and there is no friction between the layers. In
this case, we drop the subscript~$n$ of the material constants for
the sake of simplicity. To obtain the coefficients~$K_{i,n}$, we
rewrite Eqns.~\eqref{eq:boundary} and~\eqref{eq:nofriction_interface}
as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}r_{n}^{m_{1}-2} & r_{n}^{m_{2}-2} & r_{n}^{m_{3}-2} & r_{n}^{m_{4}-2}\\
g_{1}r_{n}^{m_{1}-2} & g_{2}r_{n}^{m_{2}-2} & g_{3}r_{n}^{m_{3}-2} & g_{4}r_{n}^{m_{4}-2}\\
r_{n-1}^{m_{1}-2} & r_{n-1}^{m_{2}-2} & r_{n-1}^{m_{3}-2} & r_{n-1}^{m_{4}-2}\\
g_{1}r_{n-1}^{m_{1}-2} & g_{2}r_{n-1}^{m_{2}-2} & g_{3}r_{n-1}^{m_{3}-2} & g_{4}r_{n-1}^{m_{4}-2}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}K_{1,n}\\
K_{2,n}\\
K_{3,n}\\
K_{4,n}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-\mu_{1}\\
-\mu_{2}\\
-\mu_{1}\\
-\mu_{2}
\end{bmatrix},\label{eq:eqs of Kin_one_mat_no_friction}
\end{equation}
for~$n=1,2,\dots,N$. Let layer thickness~$\Delta r=\pr{r_{N}-r_{0}}/N$,
radius sequence~$r_{n}=r_{0}+n\cdot\Delta r$. Applying Taylor series
expansion on the inverse of the coefficient matrix of~$K_{i,n}$
around~$r_{n}$, we have 
\begin{equation}
K_{i,n}=P_{i}\cdot r_{n}^{-m_{i}+2}+O(\Delta r),\quad\text{for}\,i\in\mathcal{J},\label{eq:single_mat_Ks}
\end{equation}
where~$P_{i}$ are material constants given in~\ref{Appen:Pi}.
Substituting Eqn.~\eqref{eq:single_mat_Ks} into Eqn.~\eqref{eq:EI},
we have 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}EI & =\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i}\left(P_{i}r_{n}^{-m_{i}+2}+O(\Delta r)\right)(r_{n-1}^{m_{i,n}+2}-r_{n}^{m_{i}+2})\right]+\gamma(r_{0}^{4}-r_{N}^{4})\\
 & \begin{split}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i}\left(P_{i}r_{n}^{-m_{i}+2}+O(\Delta r)\right)(-r_{n}^{m_{i}+1}(m_{i}+2)\Delta r+O(\Delta r^{2}))\right]\\
+\gamma(r_{0}^{4}-r_{N}^{4})
\end{split}
\\
 & =-\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\left(\alpha_{i}P_{i}(m_{i}+2)r_{n}^{3}\cdot\Delta r\right)\right]+\gamma(r_{0}^{4}-r_{N}^{4})+O(\Delta r^{2}).
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:single_mat_EI}
\end{equation}
Taking the limit~$N\to\infty$, according to the definition of Riemann
integral, we convert the sum of series in Eqn.~\eqref{eq:single_mat_EI}
into integral to derive the asymptotic bending stiffness as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}(EI)_{\infty} & =-\lim\limits _{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i}P_{i}(m_{i}+2)r_{n}^{3}\Delta r\right]+\gamma(r_{0}^{4}-r_{N}^{4})+O(\Delta r^{2})\\
 & =-\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\left(\int_{r_{0}}^{r_{N}}\alpha_{i}P_{i}(m_{i}+2)r^{3}\,dr\right)+\gamma(r_{0}^{4}-r_{N}^{4})\\
 & =-\frac{r_{N}^{4}-r_{0}^{4}}{4}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i}P_{i}(m_{i}+2)+4\gamma\right].
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:single_mat_EI_final}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Heterogeneous material and no friction interface\label{sec:2mat_no_friction} }

We consider the lamination scheme of the multilayered cylindrical
composite as~$[\varphi_{I}/\varphi_{II}]_{N/2}$. That is, layers
with helical angles~$\varphi_{I}$ and~$\varphi_{II}$ are alternatively
arranged from the core to the periphery of the cylinder. We use~$I$
and~$II$ as subscripts to denote material constants of layers with
odd and even layer numbers. Under no friction interfacial condition~\eqref{eq:nofriction_interface}
and considering boundary condition~\eqref{eq:boundary}, the~$K_{i,n}$
can be solved from the following equations 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}r_{n}^{m_{1,n}-2} & r_{n}^{m_{2,n}-2} & r_{n}^{m_{3,n}-2} & r_{n}^{m_{4,n}-2}\\
g_{1,n}r_{n}^{m_{1,n}-2} & g_{2,n}r_{n}^{m_{2,n}-2} & g_{3,n}r_{n}^{m_{3,n}-2} & g_{4,n}r_{n}^{m_{4,n}-2}\\
r_{n-1}^{m_{1,n}-2} & r_{n-1}^{m_{2,n}-2} & r_{n-1}^{m_{3,n}-2} & r_{n-1}^{m_{4,n}-2}\\
g_{1,n}r_{n-1}^{m_{1,n}-2} & g_{2,n}r_{n-1}^{m_{2,n}-2} & g_{3,n}r_{n-1}^{m_{3,n}-2} & g_{4,n}r_{n-1}^{m_{4,n}-2}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}K_{1,n}\\
K_{2,n}\\
K_{3,n}\\
K_{4,n}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-\mu_{1,n}\\
-\mu_{2,n}\\
-\mu_{1,n}\\
-\mu_{2,n}
\end{bmatrix},\label{eq:eqs of Kin_two_mat_no_friction}
\end{equation}
for~$n=1,2,\dots,N$. In this case,~$K_{i,n}$ of adjacent layers
are not coupled with each other and thus can be obtained by using
the similar technique being used in the homogeneous material case.
Applying Taylor series expansion on the inverse of the coefficient
matrix of~$K_{i,n}$ around~$r_{n}$ gives 
\begin{equation}
K_{i,n}=P_{i,n}\cdot r_{n}^{-m_{i,n}+2}+O(\Delta r),\quad\text{for}\,i\in\mathcal{J},\label{eq:two_mat_no_friction_Ks}
\end{equation}
where~$P_{i,n}$ are material constants of the~$n^{\text{th}}$
layer (see~\ref{Appen:Pi}). Substituting Eqn.~\eqref{eq:two_mat_no_friction_Ks}
into Eqn.~\eqref{eq:EI}, we have 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\begin{split}EI & =\sum_{n=1}^{N}\bigg[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,n}\left(P_{i,n}r_{n}^{-m_{i,n}+2}+O(\Delta r)\right)\cdot\\
 & \qquad{}(-r_{n}^{m_{i,n}+1}(m_{i,n}+2)\Delta r+O(\Delta r^{2}))+\gamma_{n}(-4r_{n}^{3}\Delta r+O(\Delta r^{2}))\bigg]\\
 & =-\sum_{n=1}^{N}\bigg[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,n}P_{i,n}(m_{i,n}+2)+4\gamma_{n}\bigg]r_{n}^{3}\cdot\Delta r+O(\Delta r^{2}).
\end{split}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:two_mat_no_friction_EI_1}
\end{equation}
Since the arrangement of material property is periodic, the odd layers
share the same material constants~$\alpha_{i,I}$,~$P_{i,I}$,~$m_{i,I}$,
and~$\gamma_{I}$ while the even layers share the same material constants~$\alpha_{i,II}$,~$P_{i,II}$,~$m_{i,II}$,
and~$\gamma_{II}$. We rewrite Eqn.~\eqref{eq:two_mat_no_friction_EI_1}
as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}EI & =-\sum_{\text{odd layers}}\bigg[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,I}P_{i,I}(m_{i,I}+2)+4\gamma_{I}\bigg]r_{n}^{3}\cdot\Delta r\\
 & \quad{}-\sum_{\text{even layers}}\bigg[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,II}P_{i,II}(m_{i,II}+2)+4\gamma_{II}\bigg]r_{n}^{3}\cdot\Delta r+O(\Delta r^{2})\\
 & =-\frac{1}{2}\bigg\lbrace\sum_{n=1}^{N}\bigg[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,I}P_{i,I}(m_{i,I}+2)+4\gamma_{I}\bigg]r_{n}^{3}\cdot\Delta r\\
 & \quad\qquad{}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\bigg[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,II}P_{i,II}(m_{i,II}+2)+4\gamma_{II}\bigg]r_{n}^{3}\cdot\Delta r\bigg\rbrace+O(\Delta r^{2}).
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:two_mat_no_friction_EI_2}
\end{equation}
Taking the limit~$N\to\infty$, according to the definition of Riemann
integral, the Eqn.~\eqref{eq:two_mat_no_friction_EI_2} becomes 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}(EI)_{\infty} & =\frac{1}{2}\Biggl\{-\Biggl[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,I}P_{i,I}(m_{i,I}+2)+4\gamma_{I}\Biggr]\int_{r_{0}}^{r_{N}}r^{3}\,dr\\
 & \quad\qquad{}-\Biggl[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,II}P_{i,II}(m_{i,II}+2)+4\gamma_{II}\Biggr]\int_{r_{0}}^{r_{N}}r^{3}\,dr\Biggl\}\\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\left[(EI)_{I,\infty}+(EI)_{II,\infty}\right],
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:two_mat_no_friction_EI}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
(EI)_{j,\infty}=-\frac{r_{N}^{4}-r_{0}^{4}}{4}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,j}P_{i,j}(m_{i,j}+2)+4\gamma_{j}\right],\quad\text{for}\,j=I,II.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Heterogeneous material and no slip interface\label{sec:2mat_no_slip} }

For the case that the lamination scheme of the multilayered cylindrical
composite is~$[\varphi_{I}/\varphi_{II}]_{N/2}$ under no slip interfacial
condition, the~$4N$ unknowns~$K_{i,n}$ can be solved from the
boundary conditions by Eqn.~\eqref{eq:boundary} and the interfacial

where 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}D_{1,n}\\
D_{2,n}\\
D_{3,n}\\
D_{4,n}
\end{bmatrix}=-r_{n-1}^{2}\begin{bmatrix}\mu_{1,n}-\mu_{1,n-1}\\
\mu_{2,n}-\mu_{2,n-1}\\
Q_{5,n}-Q_{5,n-1}\\
W_{5,n}-W_{5,n-1}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Using bold san-serif font symbol to denote matrices, we rewrite Eqn.~\eqref{eq:eqs of Kin_two_mat_no_slip_original}
as 
\begin{equation}
\usf{B}_{n}\usf{K}_{n-1}=\usf{A}_{n}\usf{K}_{n}-\usf{D}_{n},\label{eq:eqs of Kin_two_mat_no_slip_np1}
\end{equation}
for~$n=2,3,\dots,N$. The matrices~$\usf{K}_{n-1}$ and~$\usf{K}_{n}$
are coupled with each other in this case. Therefore, each~$\usf{K}_{n}$
cannot be solved individually.

We come up with a differential equation based asymptotic analysis
method to estimate~$\usf{K}_{n}$ as~$N$ approaches infinity. For
the sake of clarity, we only post essential steps of the derivation
in this section. For the details of the complete derivation, we ask
the readers to refer to~\ref{Appen:derivations}.

We first substitute~$n$ as~$n-1$ into Eqn.~\eqref{eq:eqs of Kin_two_mat_no_slip_np1}
and combine the resulting equation with Eqn.~\eqref{eq:eqs of Kin_two_mat_no_slip_np1}
to find out the relation between~$\usf{K}_{n}$ and~$\usf{K}_{n-2}$
as 
\begin{equation}
\usf{A}_{n}\usf{K}_{n}=\usf{B}_{n}\usf{A}_{n-1}^{-1}\usf{B}_{n-1}\usf{K}_{n-2}+\usf{B}_{n}\usf{A}_{n-1}^{-1}\usf{D}_{n-1}+\usf{D}_{n}.\label{eq:knknm2}
\end{equation}
In Eqn.~\eqref{eq:knknm2}, we take Taylor series expansion on~$\usf{A}_{n-1}^{-1}$
and~$\usf{B}_{n-1}$ around~$r_{n-1}$ to obtain (see~\ref{Appen:Eqn315}
for details) 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	& \usf{B}_n \usf{A}^{-1}_{n-1} \usf{B}_{n-1} = \usf{A}_n + \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \left( \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n \usf{A}_n - \usf{A}_n \usf{m}_n \right)  + O(\Delta r^2), \\ 	& \usf{B}_n \usf{A}^{-1}_{n-1} \usf{D}_{n-1} + \usf{D}_n = \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \left( 2\usf{D}_n + \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n \usf{D}_{n-1} \right) + O(\Delta r^2), 	\end{align} 	\label{eq:bnanm1} \end{subequations}Then
by substituting Eqn.~\eqref{eq:bnanm1} into Eqn.~\eqref{eq:knknm2},
we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\begin{split}\usf{A}_{n}\usf{K}_{n} & =\left[\usf{A}_{n}+\frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}}\left(\usf{B}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\usf{B}_{n}^{-1}\usf{A}_{n}-\usf{A}_{n}\usf{m}_{n}\right)+O(\Delta r^{2})\right]\usf{K}_{n-2}\\
 & \qquad+\frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}}\left(2\usf{D}_{n}+\usf{B}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\usf{B}_{n}^{-1}\usf{D}_{n-1}\right)+O(\Delta r^{2}),
\end{split}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:knknm2appr1}
\end{equation}
which gives the asymptotic relation between~$\usf{K}_{n-2}$ and~$\usf{K}_{n}$.
From a set of representative plots for~$K_{i}$ versus~$n$ of a
100-layered structure (see Fig.~\ref{fig:two_material_no_slip_Ks}),
we deduce that the~$K_{i}$ of odd (and even) layer numbers are continuous
in the asymptotic sense (for~$N\to\infty$), which are indicated
by red dashed lines. Hence, we approximate~$\usf{K}_{n-2}$ to the
first order of~$\Delta r$ as 
\begin{equation}
\usf{K}_{n-2}=\usf{K}_{n}-2\frac{d\usf{K}_{n}}{dr}\Delta r+O(\Delta r^{2}).\label{eq:knknm2appr2}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering{}\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figure/two_material_no_slip_Ks}
\caption{A set of representative plots of~$K_{i}$ with layer number~$n$
for a cylindrical composite with lamination scheme~$[-15\degree/25\degree]_{50}$
under no slip interfacial condition.\label{fig:two_material_no_slip_Ks}}
\end{figure}

Substituting Eqn.~\eqref{eq:knknm2appr2} into Eqn.~\eqref{eq:knknm2appr1}
and making simplification (see~\ref{Appen:GovernEqnKn} for details),
we obtain a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system of~$\usf{K}_{n}$
\begin{equation}
2r_{n}\frac{d(\usf{r}_{n,n}\usf{K}_{n})}{dr}=\left(\usf{M}_{n}+\usf{m}_{n}\right)\usf{r}_{n,n}\usf{K}_{n}+r_{n}^{2}\usf{F}_{n},\label{eq:GovernEqnKn}
\end{equation}
with boundary conditions given by Eqn.~\eqref{eq:boundary}. Solving
this linear ODE system (see~\ref{Appen:SolvingODE} for the details
of the solution procedures), we obtain 
\begin{equation}
%K_{i,n}=r_{n}^{-m_{i,n}}\left(G_{i,n}^{0}r_{n}^{2}+G_{i,n}^{1}r_{n}^{\lambda_{1,n}}+G_{i,n}^{2}r_{n}^{\lambda_{2,n}}+G_{i,n}^{3}r_{n}^{\lambda_{3,n}}+G_{i,n}^{4}r_{n}^{\lambda_{4,n}}\right)
K_{i,n}=r_{n}^{-m_{i,n}}\left(G_{i,n}^{0}r_{n}^{2}+\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}G_{i,n}^{j}r_{n}^{\lambda_{j,n}}\right),\quad\text{for}\,i\in\mathcal{J},\label{eq:two_mat_no_slip_Ks}
\end{equation}
where~$G_{i,n}^{j}$ ($j=\text{0 to 4}$) and~$\lambda_{j,n}$ ($j\in\mathcal{J}$)
given by Eqn.~\eqref{eq:Gjin} are constants related to material
constants of the~$n^{\text{th}}$ layer. Substituting Eqn.~\eqref{eq:two_mat_no_slip_Ks}
into Eqn.~\eqref{eq:EI}, we obtain the bending stiffness as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}EI & =-\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\lbrace \sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,n}'\left(G_{i,n}^{0}r_{n}^{2}+\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}G_{i,n}^{j}r_{n}^{\lambda_{j,n}}\right)r_{n}+4\gamma_{n}r_{n}^{3}\right\rbrace +O(\Delta r)\\
 & =-\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\lbrace \left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,n}'G_{i,n}^{0}+4\gamma_{n}\right)r_{n}^{3}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,n}'G_{i,n}^{j}r_{n}^{1+\lambda_{j,n}}\right\rbrace +O(\Delta r),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where~$\alpha_{i,n}'=\alpha_{i,n}\left(m_{i,n}+2\right)$.

Since the material properties of the layers of the structure are alternately
arranged, the odd layers share the same material constants~$\alpha_{i,I}$,~$\gamma_{I}$,~$m_{i,I}$,~$G_{i,I}^{j}$,
and~$\lambda_{j,I}$, and the even layers have the same constants~$\alpha_{i,II}$,~$\gamma_{II}$,~$m_{i,II}$,~$G_{i,II}^{j}$,
and~$\lambda_{j,II}$. Therefore, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}EI & =-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left[\left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,I}'G_{i,I}^{0}+4\gamma_{I}\right)r_{n}^{3}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,I}'G_{i,I}^{j}r_{n}^{1+\lambda_{j,I}}\right]\\
 & \quad-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\biggr[\left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,II}'G_{i,II}^{0}+4\gamma_{II}\right)r_{n}^{3}\\
 & \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}\alpha_{i,II}'G_{i,II}^{j}r_{n}^{1+\lambda_{j,II}}\biggr]+O(\Delta r).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
As~$N\to\infty$, we obtain the asymptotic bending stiffness as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}(EI)_{\infty} & =-\frac{1}{2}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\left(\alpha_{i,I}'G_{i,I}^{0}+\alpha_{i,II}'G_{i,II}^{0}\right)+4\left(\gamma_{I}+\gamma_{II}\right)\right]\int_{r_{0}}^{r_{N}}r^{3}\,dr\\
 & \quad-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}\left[\int_{r_{0}}^{r_{N}}\left(\alpha_{i,I}'G_{i,I}^{j}r^{1+\lambda_{j,I}}+\alpha_{i,II}'G_{i,II}^{j}r^{1+\lambda_{j,II}}\right)\,dr\right]\\
 & =-\frac{1}{8}\left[\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\left(\alpha_{i,I}'G_{i,I}^{0}+\alpha_{i,II}'G_{i,II}^{0}\right)+4\left(\gamma_{I}+\gamma_{II}\right)\right]\left(r_{N}^{4}-r_{0}^{4}\right)\\
 & \quad-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{J}}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}\biggr[\frac{\alpha_{i,I}'G_{i,I}^{j}}{2+\lambda_{j,I}}\left(r_{N}^{2+\lambda_{j,I}}-r_{0}^{2+\lambda_{j,I}}\right)\\
 & \qquad\qquad\qquad\quad+\frac{\alpha_{i,II}'G_{i,II}^{j}}{2+\lambda_{j,II}}\left(r_{N}^{2+\lambda_{j,II}}-r_{0}^{2+\lambda_{j,II}}\right)\biggr].
\end{aligned}

\section{Numerical examples and discussions\label{sec:discussion} }

In this section, the bending stiffness of multilayered cylindrical
structures with different lamination schemes and interfacial conditions
are numerical studied and the asymptotic bending stiffness derived
in~$\S$\ref{sec:limit_analysis} are validated.

The the cylindrical composite is divided into~$N$ co-axial layers
with constant thickness. The innermost and outermost radii of the
cylindrical structure are taken to be~$r_{0}=2$ mm and~$r_{N}=14$
mm, respectively. Three different combinations of lamination schemes
and interfacial conditions are considered: (i)~$[-15\degree]_{N}$
and~$[25\degree]_{N}$ with no friction interfacial condition, (ii)~$[-15\degree/25\degree]_{N/2}$
with no friction interfacial condition, (iii)~$[-15\degree/25\degree]_{N/2}$
with no slip interfacial condition. In all three scenarios, the non-zero
elastic compliance components of cylindrically orthotropic material
in each layer's in material coordinate system are the same and provided
in Tab.~\ref{tab:sij}. 
\begin{table}[h]

\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The relation between bending stiffness and total layer number~$N$
for the structure consisting of homogeneous material with no friction
interface is shown as solid line in Fig.~\ref{fig:asymptotic_EI}~$\subf{A}$.
The bending stiffnesses of one-layer cylinders are 881.47 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$
and 528.11 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$ for the materials with -15$\degree$
and 25$\degree$ helical angles, respectively. As we increase the
total layer number, for both materials, the bending stiffness first
decreases rapidly then becomes stable after~$N$ is greater than
five. Although the layer thickness approaches to zero as~$N\to\infty$,
the bending stiffness converges to a non-zero constant, which is given
by Eqn.~\eqref{eq:single_mat_EI_final}. The asymptotic bending stiffness
of composite with lamination scheme~$[-15\degree]_{\infty}$ and~$[25\degree]_{\infty}$
are 722.15 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$ and 412.13 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$, respectively
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:asymptotic_EI}~$\subf{A}$). 

The relation between bending stiffness and total layer number for
the heterogeneous layer properties with no friction interface is plotted
as solid line in Fig.~\ref{fig:asymptotic_EI}~$\subf{B}$. The
lamination scheme for this case is~$[-15\degree/25\degree]_{N/2}$.
The bending stiffness oscillates as the total layer number increases
due to the alternated arrangement of the layer properties. Eventually,
it approaches to a non-zero constant as~$N\to\infty$, which is the
asymptotic bending stiffness given by Eqn.~\eqref{eq:two_mat_no_friction_EI}.
The asymptotic homogenized bending stiffness of the heterogeneous
structure is 567.14 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:asymptotic_EI}~$\subf{B}$),
which is equal to the average of those of two homogeneous materials. 

The plot of bending stiffness with total layer number for the heterogeneous
material and no slip interface case, in which the lamination scheme
is~$[-15\degree/25\degree]_{N/2}$, is shown as solid line in Fig.~\ref{fig:asymptotic_EI}~$\subf{C}$.
The bending stiffness oscillates as the total layer number increases
and approaches to a non-zero constant, which is the asymptotic bending
stiffness given by Eqn.~\eqref{eq:two_mat_no_slip_EI}. Furthermore,
it is interesting to note that the asymptotic bending stiffness of
heterogeneous structures exceeds the bending stiffness of both homogeneous
structures. The maximum bending stiffness, 1093.12 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$,
is achieved when the total layer number is five. The asymptotic bending
stiffness, 1046.94 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$, is higher than those of the
structures consisting of homogeneous materials, which are 881.47 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$
and 528.11 N$\cdot$m$^{2}$. This implies that we could build up
stiffer composite from compliant materials by designing the spatial
arrangements of laminae. 

The enhancement effect in bending stiffness of the heterogeneous structures
with no slip interface also sheds light on the role of multilayered
cylindrical orthotropic structures as observed in a number of structural
biomaterials. We believe this kind of internal structure is designed
to enhance the effective bending stiffness of the biomaterials to
support external loads. To see this, we also numerically studied the
bending stiffness of the structure made up with isotropic materials.
However we found that there is no enhancement in the asymptotic bending
stiffness when the alternative layers are made of isotropic materials.
The difference of cylindrical orthotropic and isotropic material lies
in the constitutive equations. For the cylindrical orthotropic material,
the elastic constants~$C_{i4}$ ($i\in\mathcal{J}$) is non-zero,
which implies that the axis stress~$\sigma_{zz}$ and shear strain~$\epsilon_{\theta z}$
are coupled.

\section{Conclusions\label{sec:conclusion} }

In order to obtain the asymptotic bending stiffness of multilayered
composite cylindrical structures with curvilinear orthotropy, we present
a asymptotic analysis of bending stiffness by considering infinite
number of layers in this paper. Analytical expressions of asymptotic
bending stiffness are obtained by considering the no slip and no friction
interfacial conditions and geometric arrangement of layers with different
material properties. Although we only consider two materials properties
for the heterogeneous structure, we believe that the method used in
this work can be extended to multiple materials properties with similar
analysis procedures. We show that it is possible to create stiffer
structures from compliant materials by appropriate geometric arrangement,
which provide guidance in creating bio-inspired materials with desirable
mechanical properties.

\section{Material constants}

\label{Appen:MatConst} The material constants~$m_{i}$,~$g_{i}$,~$Q_{i}$,~$W_{i}$
and~$\mu_{i}$ are dependent on elastic constants. We calculate~$m_{i}$
as 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	 m_1 & =  \sqrt{\frac{-b +\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}, \\ 	 m_2 & =  \sqrt{\frac{-b -\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}, \\ 	 m_3 & =  -\sqrt{\frac{-b +\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}, \\ 	 m_4 & =  -\sqrt{\frac{-b -\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}, \\ 	\intertext{where} 	 a & :=  \beta_{22} \beta_{44} - \beta_{24}^2, \\ 	\begin{split} 	 b & := \beta_{24}(2\beta_{14} + \beta_{24} + 2\beta_{56}) + \beta_{14}^2 \\  	 & \quad - \beta_{44}(\beta_{11} + 2\beta_{12} + \beta_{22} + \beta_{66}) - \beta_{22} \beta_{55}, 	\end{split} \\ 	c & :=  \beta_{55}(\beta_{11} + 2\beta_{12} + \beta_{22} + \beta_{66})-\beta_{56}^2. 	\end{align} \end{subequations}

We calculate~$g_{i}$,~$Q_{i}$,~$W_{i}$ as 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	g_i & = \frac{\beta_{24}m_i^2+(\beta_{14} + \beta_{24})m_i - \beta_{56}}{\beta_{44}m_i^2 - \beta_{55}}, \\ 	Q_i & = \frac{1}{m_i} \pr{\beta_{12}m_i + \beta_{22}m_i(m_i+1) - \beta_{24} g_i m_i^2}, \\ 	W_i & = \frac{1}{m_i}\pr{\beta_{55} g_i - \beta_{56}}, 	\end{align} \end{subequations}for~$i\in\mathcal{J}$.

We calculate~$Q_{5}$ and~$W_{5}$ as 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	Q_5 & = \mu_1(\beta_{12} + 3\beta_{22})-2\mu_2\beta_{24} + \frac{C_{23}}{C_{33}}, \\ 	W_5 & = \frac{1}{2}(\beta_{55}\mu_2 - \beta_{56}\mu_1), 	\end{align} 	where 	\begin{equation} 	\begin{bmatrix} 		\mu_1 \\ \mu_2 	\end{bmatrix} := 	\frac{1}{C_{33}} 	\begin{bmatrix} 		-2\beta_{14}-6\beta_{24}+\beta_{56} & 4\beta_{44}-\beta_{55} \\ 		-\beta_{11}-2\beta_{12}+3\beta_{22}-\beta_{66} & 2\beta_{14}-2\beta_{24}+\beta_{56} 	\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 	\begin{bmatrix} 			2C_{34} \\ C_{13}-C_{23} 	\end{bmatrix}. 	\end{equation} \end{subequations}

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} 	\tilde{\usf{A}}_{n} 	& := 	\begin{bmatrix} 		1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 		g_{1,n} & g_{2,n} & g_{3,n} & g_{4,n} \\ 		Q_{1,n} & Q_{2,n} & Q_{3,n} & Q_{4,n} \\ 		W_{1,n} & W_{2,n} & W_{3,n} & W_{4,n} 	\end{bmatrix}, \\ 	\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n} 	& := 	\begin{bmatrix} 		1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 		g_{1,n-1} & g_{2,n-1} & g_{3,n-1} & g_{4,n-1} \\ 		Q_{1,n-1} & Q_{2,n-1} & Q_{3,n-1} & Q_{4,n-1} \\ 		W_{1,n-1} & W_{2,n-1} & W_{3,n-1} & W_{4,n-1} 	\end{bmatrix}, \\ 	\usf{r}_{n-1,n} 	& := 	\begin{bmatrix} 		r_{n-1}^{m_{1,n}} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 		0 & r_{n-1}^{m_{2,n}} & 0 & 0 \\ 		0 & 0 & r_{n-1}^{m_{3,n}} & 0 \\ 		0 & 0 & 0 & r_{n-1}^{m_{4,n}} 	\end{bmatrix}, \\ 	\usf{m}_{n} 	& := 	\begin{bmatrix} 		m_{1,n} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 		0 & m_{2,n} & 0 & 0 \\ 		0 & 0 & m_{3,n} & 0 \\ 		0 & 0 & 0 & m_{4,n} 	\end{bmatrix}. 	\end{align} 	\label{eq:C1} \end{subequations}

It is noted that~$\tilde{\usf{A}}_{n}$,~$\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}$,
and~$\usf{m}_{n}$ are constant matrices. The coefficient matrices~$\usf{A}_{n}$
and~$\usf{B}_{n}$ in Eqn.~\eqref{eq:eqs of Kin_two_mat_no_slip_original}
can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\usf{A}_{n}=\tilde{\usf{A}}_{n}\usf{r}_{n-1,n},\quad\usf{B}_{n}=\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}\usf{r}_{n-1,n-1}.
\end{equation}
Approximating~$\usf{A}_{n-1}$ and~$\usf{B}_{n-1}$ to the first
order of~$\Delta r$ around~$r_{n-1}$, we have 

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} 	\usf{A}_{n-1} & = \usf{B}_{n} - \delta \usf{B}_{n} \Delta r + O(\Delta r^2), \\ 	\usf{B}_{n-1} & = \usf{A}_{n} - \delta \usf{A}_{n} \Delta r + O(\Delta r^2), \end{align} \end{subequations}where\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	\delta \usf{A}_{n} & = \frac{1}{r_{n-1}} \usf{A}_{n} \usf{m}_n = \frac{1}{r_{n-1}} \tilde{\usf{A}}_{n} \usf{r}_{n-1,n} \usf{m}_n, \\ 	\delta \usf{B}_{n} & = \frac{1}{r_{n-1}} \usf{B}_{n} \usf{m}_{n-1} = \frac{1}{r_{n-1}} \tilde{\usf{B}}_{n} \usf{r}_{n-1,n-1} \usf{m}_{n-1}. 	\end{align} \end{subequations}Therefore,\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	\begin{split} 		\usf{B}_n \usf{A}^{-1}_{n-1} 		& = \usf{B}_n \left[ \usf{B}_{n} - \delta \usf{B}_{n} \Delta r + O(\Delta r^2) \right]^{-1} \\ 		& = \usf{B}_n \left[ \usf{B}_{n} \left( \usf{I}- \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \usf{m}_{n-1} \right) + O(\Delta r^2) \right]^{-1} \\ 		& = \usf{B}_n \left[ \usf{I} - \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \usf{m}_{n-1} + O(\Delta r^2) \right]^{-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_{n} \\ 		& = \usf{I} + \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n + O(\Delta r^2), 	\end{split}\\ 	\begin{split} 		\usf{B}_n \usf{A}^{-1}_{n-1} \usf{B}_{n-1} 		& = \left[ \usf{I} + \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n + O(\Delta r^2) \right] \cdot \\ 		& \qquad \left[ \usf{A}_{n} - \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \usf{A}_n \usf{m}_n + O(\Delta r^2) \right] \\ 		& = \usf{A}_{n} + \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \left( \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n \usf{A}_{n} - \usf{A}_n \usf{m}_n \right) + O(\Delta r^2), 	\end{split} \\ 	\begin{split} 		\usf{B}_n \usf{A}^{-1}_{n-1} \usf{D}_{n-1} + \usf{D}_n 		& = \left[ \usf{I} + \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n + O(\Delta r^2) \right] \usf{D}_{n-1} + \usf{D}_n \\ 		& = \usf{D}_{n-1} + \usf{D}_n + \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n \usf{D}_{n-1} + O(\Delta r^2) \\ 		& = \frac{\Delta r}{r_{n-1}} \left( 2\usf{D}_n + \usf{B}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \usf{B}^{-1}_n \usf{D}_{n-1} \right) + O(\Delta r^2). 	\end{split} 	\end{align} 	\label{eq:C5} \end{subequations} 

\subsection{Derivation of ODE system given by~\eqref{eq:GovernEqnKn} and~\eqref{eq:boundary}\label{Appen:GovernEqnKn}}

Substituting Eqn.~\eqref{eq:knknm2appr2} into Eqn.~\eqref{eq:knknm2appr1},
we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}r_{n-1}\frac{d\usf{K}_{n}}{dr}= & \left(\usf{A}_{n}^{-1}\usf{B}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\usf{B}_{n}^{-1}\usf{A}_{n}-\usf{m}_{n}\right)\usf{K}_{n}\\
 & +\usf{A}_{n}^{-1}\left(2\usf{D}_{n}+\usf{B}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\usf{B}_{n}^{-1}\usf{D}_{n-1}\right)+O(\Delta r).
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:AppendKndr1}
\end{equation}

Taking the zero order of approximation of Eqn.~\eqref{eq:AppendKndr1}
around~$r_{n}$ and noting that 
\begin{equation}
\usf{B}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\usf{B}_{n}^{-1}=\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}^{-1},
\end{equation}
we have 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\begin{split}2r_{n}\frac{d\usf{K}_{n}}{dr}= & \left(\usf{r}_{n,n}^{-1}\tilde{\usf{A}}_{n}^{-1}\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}^{-1}\tilde{\usf{A}}_{n}\usf{r}_{n,n}-\usf{m}_{n}\right)\usf{K}_{n}\\
 & +r_{n}^{2}\usf{r}_{n,n}^{-1}\tilde{\usf{A}}_{n}^{-1}\left(-2\usf{I}+\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}\usf{m}_{n-1}\tilde{\usf{B}}_{n}^{-1}\right)\tilde{\usf{D}}_{n}+O(\Delta r),
\end{split}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:AppendKndr2}
\end{equation}
where~$\tilde{\usf{D}}_{n}$ is a constant vector 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\usf{D}}_{n}=\begin{bmatrix}\mu_{1,n}-\mu_{1,n-1}\\
\mu_{2,n}-\mu_{2,n-1}\\
Q_{5,n}-Q_{5,n-1}\\
W_{5,n}-W_{5,n-1}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Let 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	\usf{M}_n & := \tilde{\usf{A}}^{-1}_n \tilde{\usf{B}}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \tilde{\usf{B}}^{-1}_n \tilde{\usf{A}}_n, \\ 	\usf{F}_n & := \tilde{\usf{A}}^{-1}_n \left( -2\usf{I} + \tilde{\usf{B}}_n \usf{m}_{n-1} \tilde{\usf{B}}^{-1}_n \right) \tilde{\usf{D}}_n, 	\end{align} \end{subequations}

We rewrite Eqn.~\eqref{eq:AppendKndr2} as 
\begin{equation}
2r_{n}\frac{d\usf{K}_{n}}{dr}=\left(\usf{r}_{n,n}^{-1}\usf{M}_{n}\usf{r}_{n,n}+\usf{m}_{n}\right)\usf{K}_{n}+r_{n}^{2}\usf{r}_{n,n}^{-1}\usf{F}_{n}.\label{eq:AppendKndr}
\end{equation}
Then multiplying Eqn.~\eqref{eq:AppendKndr} by~$\usf{r}_{n,n}$
on both sides, we obtain a linear ODE system of~$\usf{K}_{n}$ 
\begin{equation}
2r_{n}\frac{d\pr{\usf{r}_{n,n}\usf{K}_{n}}}{dr}=\pr{\usf{M}_{n}+\usf{m}_{n}}\pr{\usf{r}_{n,n}\usf{K}_{n}}+r_{n}^{2}\usf{F}_{n},\label{eq:AppendKn}
\end{equation}
with boundary conditions given by~\eqref{eq:boundary}.

\subsection{Solution procedures of ODE system given by~\eqref{eq:GovernEqnKn}
and~\eqref{eq:boundary}}

\label{Appen:SolvingODE}

The ODE system of~$\usf{K}_{n}$ given by~\eqref{eq:GovernEqnKn}
and~\eqref{eq:boundary} is equivalent to 
\begin{equation}
2r_{n}\frac{d\usf{K}_{n}^{e}}{dr}=\usf{M}_{n}^{e}\usf{K}_{n}^{e}+r_{n}^{2}\usf{F}_{n},\label{eq:AppendKendr}
\end{equation}
where~$\usf{K}_{n}^{e}=\usf{r}_{n,n}\usf{K}_{n}$ and~$\usf{M}_{n}^{e}=\usf{M}_{n}+\usf{m}_{n}$.
with boundary conditions 

\begin{subequations} 	\begin{align} 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K^e_{i,1} r_0^{-2} & = -\mu_{1,1}, \quad 	 \sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K^e_{i,1} g_{i,1} r_0^{-2} = -\mu_{2,1},\\ 	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K^e_{i,N} r_N^{-2} & = -\mu_{1,N}, \quad 	 \sum_{i \in \mathcal{J}} K^e_{i,N} g_{i,N} r_N^{-2} = -\mu_{2,N}. 	\end{align} 	\label{eq:Appenboundary} \end{subequations}

Since the material properties of the multilayered material is alternately
arranged, the constant coefficient matrix~$\usf{M}_{n}^{e}$ and~$\usf{F}_{n}$
for the odd (and even) layers are the same and are denoted as~$\usf{M}_{I}^{e}$,~$\usf{F}_{I}$
(and~$\usf{M}_{II}^{e}$,~$\usf{F}_{II}$). In the asymptotic sense
($N\to\infty$),~$\usf{K}_{n}$ of odd and even layers are continuous
functions of the radius~$r$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:two_material_no_slip_Ks}).
Then Eqn.~\eqref{eq:AppendKendr} becomes 

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} 	2 r \frac{d\usf{K}_n^e}{dr} & = \usf{M}_I^e \usf{K}_n^e + r^2 \usf{F}_I, \quad \text{for odd~$n$}, \\ 	2 r \frac{d\usf{K}_n^e}{dr} & = \usf{M}_{II}^e \usf{K}_n^e + r^2 \usf{F}_{II}, \quad \text{for even~$n$}. \end{align} \label{eq:AppendKejdr} \end{subequations}
We can obtain~$\usf{K}_{n}$ of the odd and even layers by solving
Eqn.~\eqref{eq:AppendKejdr} separately. The above two ODE systems
have similar format. For simplicity, we drop the subscripts~$I$
and~$II$ that denote material constants of odd and even layers in
the following derivations. We diagonalize the matrix~$\usf{M}^{e}$
as 
\begin{equation}
\usf{M}^{e}=(\usf{M}^{\nu})^{-1}\usf{\Lambda}^{\nu}\usf{M}^{\nu},
\end{equation}
where~$\usf{\Lambda}^{\nu}=\text{diag}(\lambda_{1}^{\nu},\lambda_{2}^{\nu},\lambda_{3}^{\nu},\lambda_{4}^{\nu})$
and~$\usf{M}^{\nu}$ are respectively the eigenvalue and eigenvector
matrices of~$\usf{M}^{e}$,~$\lambda_{i}^{\nu}$ are eigenvalues.
We denote~$\usf{\Lambda}=\text{diag}(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\lambda_{3},\lambda_{4})$,
where~$\lambda_{i}=\lambda_{i}^{\nu}/2$ for~$i\in\mathcal{J}$.
Then it follows that~$\usf{\Lambda}=\usf{\Lambda}^{\nu}/2$. Let
\begin{equation}
\usf{Y}=\usf{M}^{\nu}\usf{K}^{e},\quad\usf{L}=\frac{1}{2}\usf{M}^{\nu}\usf{F},
\end{equation}
then Eqn.~\eqref{eq:AppendKejdr} becomes 
\begin{equation}
r\frac{d\usf{Y}}{dr}=\usf{\Lambda}\usf{Y}+r^{2}\usf{L}.\label{eq:AppendYndr}
\end{equation}
The solution of Eqn.~\eqref{eq:AppendYndr} reads 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}Y_{1}\\
Y_{2}\\
Y_{3}\\
Y_{4}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{L_{1}}{2-\lambda_{1}}\\
\frac{L_{2}}{2-\lambda_{2}}\\
\frac{L_{3}}{2-\lambda_{3}}\\
\frac{L_{4}}{2-\lambda_{4}}
\end{bmatrix}r^{2}+\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}r^{\lambda_{1}}\\
c_{2}r^{\lambda_{2}}\\
c_{3}r^{\lambda_{3}}\\
c_{4}r^{\lambda_{4}}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where~$c_{i}$ are the integration constants.

Therefore,~$\usf{K}_{n}^{e}$ of the odd and even layers are 

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} \usf{K}_n^e & = \left( \usf{M}_I^{\nu} \right)^{-1}\usf{Y}_I, \quad \text{for odd~$n$}, \\ \usf{K}_n^e & = \left( \usf{M}_{II}^{\nu} \right)^{-1}\usf{Y}_{II}, \quad \text{for even~$n$}, \end{align} \end{subequations}where
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}Y_{1,n}\\
Y_{2,n}\\
Y_{3,n}\\
Y_{4,n}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{L_{1,n}}{2-\lambda_{1,n}}\\
\frac{L_{2,n}}{2-\lambda_{2,n}}\\
\frac{L_{3,n}}{2-\lambda_{3,n}}\\
\frac{L_{4,n}}{2-\lambda_{4,n}}
\end{bmatrix}r^{2}+\begin{bmatrix}c_{1,n}r^{\lambda_{1,n}}\\
c_{2,n}r^{\lambda_{2,n}}\\
c_{3,n}r^{\lambda_{3,n}}\\
c_{4,n}r^{\lambda_{4,n}}
\end{bmatrix},\quad\text{for}\,n=I,II.
\end{equation}
The integration constants~$c_{i,n}$ are determined by the boundary
condition given by Eqn.~\eqref{eq:Appenboundary}. % and interfacial condition
% \begin{equation}
% 	\tilde{\usf{A}}_n \usf{K}_n^e = \tilde{\usf{B}}_n \usf{K}_{n-1}^e + r^2 \tilde{\usf{D}}_n.
% \end{equation}
Finally we obtain~$\usf{K}_{n}$ of the odd and even layers given
by 

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} 	\usf{K}_n & = (\usf{r}_{n,n})^{-1} (\usf{M}_I^{\nu})^{-1}\usf{Y}_I, \quad \text{for odd~$n$}, \\ 	\usf{K}_n & = (\usf{r}_{n,n})^{-1} (\usf{M}_{II}^{\nu})^{-1}\usf{Y}_{II}, \quad \text{for even~$n$}. \end{align} \label{eq:appenKn_I_II} \end{subequations}Substituting
the terms in Eqn.~\eqref{eq:appenKn_I_II}, we obtain a general expression
of~$\usf{K}_{n}$ in component form as 
\begin{equation}
K_{i,n}=r_{n}^{-m_{i,n}}\left(G_{i,n}^{0}r_{n}^{2}+\sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}G_{i,n}^{j}r_{n}^{\lambda_{j,n}}\right),\quad\text{for~\ensuremath{i\in\mathcal{J}}},\label{eq:appenKn}
\end{equation}
where~$G_{i,n}^{j}$ are constants given by 

\begin{subequations} \begin{align} 	G^0_{i,n}& := \sum_{k \in \mathcal{J}} \pr{\usf{M}_n^{\nu}}^{-1}_{ik} \frac{L_{k,n}}{2 - \lambda_{k,n}}, \\ 	G^j_{i,n}& := \pr{\usf{M}_n^{\nu}}^{-1}_{ij} c_{j,n}, \quad \text{for}\, j\in \mathcal{J} . \end{align} \label{eq:Gjin} \end{subequations}
